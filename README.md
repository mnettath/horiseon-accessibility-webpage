# horiseon-accessibility-webpage

## Description

The purpose of this challenge was to provide Horiseon, a marketing agency, with a codebase that follows accessibility standards. This helps to optimize their site for search engines. I took on this challenge to better familiarize myself with semantic HTML elements, alt attributes, and different ways to organize CSS selectors. Additionally, I I learned how to debug the application's links and add comments directly into the code to explain what I changed.
